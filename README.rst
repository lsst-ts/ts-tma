TMA Documentation

ts-tma
======

The vendor for the TMA is Tekniker.
They will be providing a  PDF documents for operating the TMA.
In an effort to have consistency across software documentation I will be transcribing the TMA documents onto this TMA Technote. 

**Links:**

- Publication URL: https://ts-tma.lsst.io
- Alternative editions: https://ts-tma.lsst.io/v
- GitHub repository: https://github.com/lsst-tstn/ts-tma

Build this technical note
=========================

You can clone this repository and build the technote locally with `Sphinx`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/lsst-tstn/ts-tma
   cd ts-tma
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   make html

.. note::

   In a Conda_ environment, ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` doesn't work as expected.
   Instead, ``pip`` install the packages listed in ``requirements.txt`` individually.

The built technote is located at ``_build/html/index.html``.

Editing this technical note
===========================

You can edit the ``index.rst`` file, which is a reStructuredText document.
The `DM reStructuredText Style Guide`_ is a good resource for how we write reStructuredText.

Remember that images and other types of assets should be stored in the ``_static/`` directory of this repository.
See ``_static/README.rst`` for more information.

The published technote at https://ts-tma.lsst.io will be automatically rebuilt whenever you push your changes to the ``master`` branch on `GitHub <https://github.com/lsst-tstn/ts-tma>`_.

Updating metadata
=================

This technote's metadata is maintained in ``metadata.yaml``.
In this metadata you can edit the technote's title, authors, publication date, etc..
``metadata.yaml`` is self-documenting with inline comments.

Using the bibliographies
========================

The bibliography files in ``lsstbib/`` are copies from `lsst-texmf`_.
You can update them to the current `lsst-texmf`_ versions with::

   make refresh-bib

Add new bibliography items to the ``local.bib`` file in the root directory (and later add them to `lsst-texmf`_).
