	#. The cabinet is now powered on, which means the PC to operate the EUI is also powered on.

	.. note:: It may take a bit for the PC to power on.

Debugging the PILZ box
======================
Sometimes when resetting the interlocks on the CCW, the PILZ box does not reset properly.
You can check this by opening the power cabinet and looking for a row of red LEDs that indicate fault.
You can handle this by turning the pilz box on and off again.

1. Unplug the rightmost power cable in the row of power cables
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Plug it in again
4. An array of green lights should come up
